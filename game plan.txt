rooms:
- grimy flat (doors to shoe closet, street)
- the closet (find a guide to the space dick in a disused handbag)
- the street (acquire glitter)(leads from flat to beach, west street, volks)
- the beach (many, many stones) (leads to space dick, pub, sea)
- a lovely soothing pub (with a terrifying cellar where you must choose the correct keg 
to change in order to escape)
- the sea (you can drown here)
- west street (battle zone, need many stones)(leads to horrible nightclub of cunts)
- a horrible nightclub full of cunts (guess the password to get in)(get money)
- the volks (get drugs if you've got money and glitter)
- the space dick (can go to space if you've bought drugs at volks and have flying instructions)
- space (you will go to space today!)
